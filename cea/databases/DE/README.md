## Description

Building typology for the German building stock adapted to CEA database format. Accompanying documentation.md file details all assumptions and sources used to compile the database. Please cite the paper published at the BauSIM 2024 conference proceedings.

The overall goal is to improve the current database creation process and CEA templates with our case studies from Germany. This collaborative project was born out of the CEA User Meeting 2023 with the explicit goal to publish this Germany database for all CEA users.
