How to Use Github?
==================

Welcome to the CEA development team! This guide will explain the main workflow of CEA, including basic functions 
and formatting preferences of the Zenhub plugin and Github Desktop.

.. Note:: The following assumes that you have already have a Github account. If not, please create an account at `Github <https://github.com/>`_.


Zenhub Plugin
-------------

The CEA team uses the `Zenhub Plugin <https://www.zenhub.com/extension/>`_ to facilitate communication between developers. The plugin creates a Zenhub tab in the CEA github repository and applies a scrum-style framework to application development. Groups of tasks can be lumped together into themed initiatives (called epics) which comprise of discrete tasks (called issues). For example, ``Bugs and Errors`` may be an epic containing a number of discrete issues such as ``Function X fails with KeyError Y``.

Each Issue/User Story can be assigned a status in the pipeline of Zenhub, label (e.g. documentation), assignee, milestone, estimate, epic and release - feel free to use any which are appropriate.

Pipelines are assigned using the following protocol:
    - Icebox: new issues which are identified but not currently in progress.
    - New initiatives and Active initiatives: these are reserved for epics and should not be used for an individual issue.
    - Breakdown: when new issues are in progress, they should be moved to this pipeline.
    - In development: this is reserved for issues which may stem from the breakdown phase and a worked on individually.
    - In review: issues are automatically assigned to this pipeline when a pull request is submitted.
    - Close issues: these are old issues which have been successfully merged.

Zenhub will then create the issue and assign an identification number.



Github Desktop Workflow
-----------------------
`Github desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>`_ is a handy user interface for tracking and merging local alterations to the remote repository.

For more information and visual walk-through, please check out the `Github desktop guides <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/>`_.

When addressing an issue raised in Zenhub, it is important to note the following processes:

Git pull and branching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For more detailed information see the `creating a branch guide <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/>`_

#. Open Github Desktop
#. Click pull origin if working on a clean branch (no uncommitted local changes).
	- git fetch: fetches any commits from the target branch and stores them in your local repository.
	- git merge: integrates fetched commits into your working branch and files.
	- git pull: performs a git fetch and git merge. Pulling integrates any fetched commits into your current working branch, which can create merge conflicts.
#.  If altering an existing branch:
	- Select current branch and search for the issue number assigned by Zenhub.
    If creating a new branch:
	- Press Ctrl+Shift+N (or current branch > new branch from the drop down list).
	- Name the new branch based on the following format ``issue#-issue-name-lower-case-hyphenated``
	    e.g. ``107-documentation-needs-updating``
#. Click Repository from the drop down menu.
#. Select ``Open in command prompt`` OR ``Show in explorer`` OR use your preferred text editor (e.g. Pycharm) depending on preference.
#. Open and perform necessary modifications or additions to scripts or files.
#. Ensure all changes are tested for functionality.
#. Save alterations once completed.


Git commit
^^^^^^^^^^
For more information see the `committing and reviewing changes guide <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project/>`_.

#. Return to Github desktop.
#. Review all changes in the Changes tab on the left hand side.
#. In the bottom left corner, write a brief summary of your changes followed by a description of what has been changed and why.
#. Click ``Commit to...`` button, ensuring you are committing to the correct branch.
	- git commit: committing tracks and saves any changes or new files created locally.
#. Repeat processes until you are ready to merge with the master repository.

Git push
^^^^^^^^^
For more information see the `pushing your changes guide <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project/>`_.

#. When ready to update team members with your changes, ensure latest changes are committed.
#. Select ``Push origin``.
	- git push: pushes your local commits to the remote repository. Note: branches and commits will be available to others only once pushed to the origin.

How to create a pull request
----------------------------
If you're happy with your contribution to CEA, it's ready to merge with the master branch, also known as a pull request!

1. Open the `remote repository <https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/CityEnergyAnalyst>`_
in your browser OR in Github Desktop under `branch <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request/>`_.

2. If you're using your browser click the ``pull requests`` tab.
3. Select ``New Pull Request``.
