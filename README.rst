The  `City Energy Analyst (CEA) <https://www.cityenergyanalyst.com/>`_ is an urban building simulation platform and one
of the first open-source initiatives of computation tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient cities.
The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning and energy systems engineering in an integrated simulation platform. This
allows to study the effects, trade-offs and synergies of urban design options and energy infrastructure plans.
