THE CITY ENERGY ANALYST
=========================

The City Energy Analyst (CEA) is an urban building simulation platform and one of the first open-source initiatives of computation tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient cities. The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning and energy systems engineering in an integrated simulation platform. This allows to study the effects, trade-offs and synergies of urban design options and energy infrastructure plans.
