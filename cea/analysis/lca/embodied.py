    """
    Algorithm to calculate the embodied emissions and non-renewable primary energy of buildings according to the method
    of [Fonseca et al., 2015] and [Thoma et al., 2014]. The calculation method assumes a 60 year payoff for the embodied
    energy and emissions of a building, after which both values become zero.

    The results are provided in total as well as per square meter:

    - embodied non-renewable primary energy: E_nre_pen_GJ and E_nre_pen_MJm2
    - embodied greenhouse gas emissions: GHG_sys_embodied_tonCO2yr and GHG_sys_embodied_kgCO2m2yr

    As part of the algorithm, the following files are read from InputLocator:

    - architecture.shp: shapefile with the architecture of each building
        locator.get_building_architecture()
    - occupancy.shp: shapefile with the occupancy types of each building
        locator.get_building_occupancy()
    - age.shp: shapefile with the age and retrofit date of each building
        locator.get_building_age()
    - zone.shp: shapefile with the geometry of each building in the zone of study
        locator.get_zone_geometry()
    - Archetypes_properties: csv file with the database of archetypes including embodied energy and emissions
        locator.get_database_construction_standards()

    As a result, the following file is created:

    - Total_LCA_embodied: .csv
        csv file of yearly primary energy and grey emissions per building stored in locator.get_lca_embodied()

    :param year_to_calculate:  year between 1900 and 2100 indicating when embodied energy is evaluated
        to account for emissions already offset from building construction and retrofits more than 60 years ago.
