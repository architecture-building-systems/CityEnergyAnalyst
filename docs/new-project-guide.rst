How to create a new project?
============================


This guide presents a few steps about how to create a new project in CEA. 

The main steps you need to take are:

#. Gather minimum data inputs.
#. Run the create new project tool.
#. Run the data helper tool.


Step 1. Gather minimum data
---------------------------

The objective of this step is to collect the minimum set of inputs needed for a new project. There are basically four(4) files you need to collect to start with CEA.

#. Surroundings geometry file: A shapefile storing the geometry of buildings and surroundings
#. Zone geometry file: A shapefile storing the geometry of buildings.
#. Streets geometry file: A shapefile storing streets and pathways
#. Terrain file: Digital elevation model of the terrain.

.. note:: all prerequisites MUST comply with the naming and structure described in the tutorial
          of `Input databases of CEA <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14cgSAhNGnjTDLx_rco9mWU9FFLk0s50FBd_ud9AK7pU/edit#slide=id.g1d85a4d9be_0_0>`__.


Step 2. Create new project tool
-------------------------------

CEA holds a particular folder structure in order to do calls between scripts and tools. In addition, CEA uses an specific Geographic Coordinate System (WSG84) and specific Projected Coordinate System (UTM). We have created a tool to standardise your input data with ease.

This tool will also add new input databases to your project.

The objective of this step is to use the configuration editor to set up the input parameters of the create-new-project tool.

#. Open the configuration editor of CEA. This guide :doc:`config-file-guide` describes how to use it.
#. In the configuration editor, scroll down the menu on the left and click in "Create-new-project" tool.
#. On the right side proceed to give an input to the next variables:

    ===================  =========  ==========================================
    Variable             Unit       Description
    ===================  =========  ==========================================
    project              [-]        name of the new project to create

    scenario             [-]        name of the baseline scenario of the
                                    project.

    occupancy-type       [-]        list of occupancy types in your building stock

    zone                 [-]        path to shapefile with geometry of zone

    surroundings         [-]        path to shapefile with geometry of surroundings

    streets              [-]        path to shapefile with geometry of streets

    output-path          [-]        location to where to create the new project
    ===================  =========  ==========================================

#. Click save and close the configuration editor.
#. Open Pycharm and the project City Energy Analyst.
#. From the project tab on the left run the create new project tool. The tool is stored
   in CityEnergyAnalyst>cea>datamanagement>create_new_project.py.


Step 3. Archetype Mapper tool
-----------------------------

The objective of this step will be to create additional input databases of your project and add default values to them.
In the next step you will be free to edit or replace those databases according to the real or expected values
of your project. For more information of these databases take a look to `Input databases of CEA <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14cgSAhNGnjTDLx_rco9mWU9FFLk0s50FBd_ud9AK7pU/edit#slide=id.g1d85a4d9be_0_0>`__.

#. Open Pycharm and the project City Energy Analyst.
#. From the the project tab on the left run the data helper tool. The tool is stored
   in CityEnergyAnalyst>cea>datamanagement>archetypes_mapper.py.

Finally, the new input databases can be edited or replaced to agree with the inputs that your project may have. To edit these databases check the guide on `How to edit databases in CEA <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16LXsu0vbllRL-in_taABuiThJ2uMP9Q05m3ORdaQrvU/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0>`__.
