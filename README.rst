The  `City Energy Analyst (CEA) <https://www.cityenergyanalyst.com/>`_ is an urban energy simulation platform and one
of the first open-source computational tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient neighborhoods and districts
The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning and energy systems engineering in an integrated framework. This
allows to study the effects, trade-offs and synergies of urban design options, building retrofits and energy infrastructure plans.
