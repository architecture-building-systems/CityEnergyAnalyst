# Thermal Network Design

Thermal network design features enable the planning and analysis of district heating and cooling systems. The process is divided into two parts: layout generation and thermal hydraulic analysis.

## Thermal Network Part 1: Layout

### Overview
Automatically generates thermal network piping layouts using minimum spanning tree algorithms that follow street geometries. This feature creates the spatial configuration of district heating (DH) or district cooling (DC) networks connecting buildings to central plants.

### When to Use
- Designing new district heating or cooling networks
- Comparing different network configurations
- Estimating network length and coverage
- Planning infrastructure for district energy systems

### How It Works
The algorithm:
1. Identifies buildings to connect based on demand
2. Finds optimal pipe routes following streets
3. Minimizes total pipe length
4. Creates network nodes and edges
5. Outputs GIS shapefiles for the network

### Prerequisites
- **Energy Demand Part 2** - Must be completed (to know building loads)
- **Streets Helper** - Street network must exist
- Zone geometry

### Required Input Files
- **Street network**: Shapefile of streets (`streets.shp`)
- **Total demand**: Building energy demands (`Total_demand.csv`)
- **Zone geometry**: Building footprints

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Typical Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Network type** | DH (heating) or DC (cooling) | DH or DC |
| **Allow looped networks** | Create redundant paths | No (tree) |
| **Consider all buildings** | Or select subset to connect | All with demand |

### How to Use

1. **Complete prerequisites**:
   - ✅ Energy Demand calculation
   - ✅ Streets Helper (street network)

2. **Run layout generation**:
   - Navigate to **Thermal Network Design**
   - Select **Thermal Network Part 1: Layout**
   - Choose network type (DH or DC)
   - Configure options
   - Click **Run**

3. **Processing time**: Usually < 1 minute for typical districts

### Output Files

**Network edges**: `{scenario}/inputs/networks/DH/edges.shp` (or DC)
- Pipe segments along streets
- Length of each segment
- Start/end coordinates

**Network nodes**: `{scenario}/inputs/networks/DH/nodes.shp` (or DC)
- Building connection points
- Pipe junctions
- Node coordinates and building references

### Understanding Layout Results

Key metrics to review:
- **Total pipe length** (m or km)
- **Number of connected buildings**
- **Network density** (pipe length per connected building)
- **Building connection points**

Typical network characteristics:
- Tree networks: Pipe length = 0.8-1.5× linear distance between buildings
- Looped networks: Pipe length = 1.2-2.0× tree network length
- Urban density: 20-80 m pipe per building

### Visualising the Network
1. Use CEA-4 App 3D viewer to see network overlay
2. Export to Rhino/Grasshopper for detailed visualisation
3. Open shapefiles in QGIS or ArcGIS

### Tips
- **Accurate streets matter**: Network follows streets, so street quality affects results
- **Check connectivity**: Verify all desired buildings are connected
- **Consider future expansion**: Leave capacity for additional connections
- **Manual editing**: You can manually edit the generated shapefiles if needed

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Not all buildings connected
- **Solution**: Check street network covers all building areas
- **Solution**: Some buildings may be too far from streets

**Issue**: Network layout doesn't follow streets well
- **Solution**: Improve street network quality with Streets Helper
- **Solution**: Manually add missing street segments

**Issue**: Missing output shapefiles
- **Solution**: Check for error messages in the log
- **Solution**: Verify Total_demand.csv exists and has valid data

### Understanding Results

#### Key Performance Indicators

**Heat Losses**:
- Well-designed DH: 10-20% annual losses
- Older DH networks: 20-35% losses
- Low-temperature DH: 5-15% losses

**Pumping Energy**:
- Typical: 1-3% of delivered heat energy
- Long networks or high ΔT: Up to 5%
- Affects system efficiency significantly

**Pipe Sizes**:
- Small buildings: DN25-DN50 (25-50 mm diameter)
- Medium buildings: DN50-DN100
- Main distribution: DN100-DN300
- Large district mains: DN300-DN600

#### Validation Checks

1. **Pressure feasibility**: All pressures should be positive (no cavitation)
2. **Temperature feasibility**: Return temp > supply temp at all points should never occur
3. **Reasonable losses**: Total losses typically 10-20% for new networks
4. **Flow velocities**: Typically 0.5-3 m/s (check derived from mass flow and diameter)

### Advanced Options

#### Network Temperature Regimes

**High-Temperature DH** (80-90°C):
- Traditional systems
- Higher heat losses
- Suitable for old buildings

**Low-Temperature DH** (50-70°C):
- Modern systems
- Lower heat losses
- Requires better building insulation
- Enables heat recovery sources

**Very Low-Temperature DH** (30-50°C):
- Ultra-modern systems
- Minimal heat losses
- Requires heat pumps at buildings
- Can also provide cooling

#### Pipe Insulation Standards

- **Standard**: Typical for urban DH (λ ≈ 0.023 W/mK)
- **High performance**: Better insulation for lower losses (λ ≈ 0.018 W/mK)
- **Twin pipes**: Pre-insulated pipe pairs (supply + return)

### Tips

1. **Temperature optimization**: Lower supply temperatures reduce heat losses
2. **Pressure management**: Long networks may need intermediate pumping stations
3. **Insulation pays off**: Better insulation reduces operating costs
4. **Validate with reality**: Compare results with existing network data if available
5. **Consider future growth**: Size pipes with expansion margin (10-20%)

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Simulation fails or crashes
- **Solution**: Check network layout for disconnected segments
- **Solution**: Verify all buildings in network have valid demand data
- **Solution**: Try disabling multiprocessing for debugging

**Issue**: Unrealistic pressure drops (very high or negative)
- **Solution**: Check network connectivity and flow directions
- **Solution**: Verify pipe properties in database
- **Solution**: Review supply/return temperature settings

**Issue**: Very high heat losses (>30%)
- **Solution**: Check pipe insulation settings
- **Solution**: Verify ground temperature is reasonable
- **Solution**: Consider lower supply temperatures

**Issue**: No pump requirements calculated
- **Solution**: Check that network has defined plant location
- **Solution**: Verify pressure boundary conditions
