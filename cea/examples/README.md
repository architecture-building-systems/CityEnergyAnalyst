# OPEN EXAMPLES FOR THE CITY ENERGY ANALYST

## How to use:

1. In ArcGIS create a new folder connection to this folder.

2. Alternatively, point the variable self.scenario_reference in globalvar.py to the scenario inside the folder.
    this will mean that all the scripts can be run from the source.

    Example:

    self.scenario_reference = r'c:\reference-case-open\baseline'
