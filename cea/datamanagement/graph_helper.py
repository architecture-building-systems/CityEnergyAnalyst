Graph correction utilities for street network graphs.

This module provides centralized graph correction methods to fix common connectivity issues
in street network graphs obtained from OpenStreetMap. These corrections ensure that the
graphs are suitable for Steiner tree optimization and network layout calculations.

TYPICAL USAGE
=============

Basic usage - automatic corrections:
    from cea.datamanagement.graph_helper import GraphCorrector
    corrector = GraphCorrector(street_network_graph)
    corrected_graph = corrector.apply_corrections()
    print(corrector.get_corrections_log())

Manual usage - specific corrections:
    corrector = GraphCorrector(street_network_graph)
    corrector.merge_close_nodes()
    corrector.connect_intersecting_edges()
    corrected_graph = corrector.graph

Validate before Steiner tree:
    is_ready, message = GraphCorrector.validate_steiner_tree_ready(graph, terminal_nodes)
    if not is_ready:
        print(f"Graph validation failed: {message}")

CORRECTION PIPELINE
===================

The apply_corrections() method applies corrections in this order:
1. Remove self-loops - Eliminates invalid edges from nodes to themselves
2. Merge close nodes - Fixes coordinate precision issues (within SNAP_TOLERANCE = 0.1m)
3. Connect intersecting edges - Adds junction nodes where edges cross but don't connect
4. Connect disconnected components - Last resort: adds edges between nearest nodes

Each correction logs its actions for traceability.
