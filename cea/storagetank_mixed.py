S. Hsieh script development          20.04.16

This algorithm describes the energy conversion process of a fully mixed sensible heat storage tank (water based).
Calculation refers to E+ documentation.

Input variables: V (tank size), U_tank (tank Insulation Property), AR (tank Aspect Ratio)
Output variables: Qww_ls_st(sensible heat loss from storage tank), Tww_st(storage tank temperature)

    This algorithm calculates the heat flows within a fully mixed water storage tank.
    Heat flows include sensible heat loss to the environment (ql), heat charged into the tank (qc), and heat discharged from the tank (qd).

    ----------
    :param Tww_st_0: Initial tank temperature in C
    :param V: dhw tank size in m3
    :param Qww: dhw demand in W
    :param Qww_ls_r: recoverable loss in distribution in W
    :param Qww_ls_nr: non-recoverable loss in distribution in W
    :param Utank: dhw tank insulation heat transfer coefficient in W/m2-K, value taken from SIA 385. global variable.

    Returns
    -------
    :return ql: storage sensible heat loss in W.
    :return qd: heat discharged from the tank in W.
