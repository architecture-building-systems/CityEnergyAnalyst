City Energy Analyst (CEA)
--------------------------

The `City Energy Analyst (CEA) <https://www.cityenergyanalyst.com/>`_ is an urban building energy simulation platform and one of the first open-source initiatives of computation tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient cities. The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning and energy systems engineering in an integrated simulation platform. This allows to study of the effects, trade-offs, and synergies of urban design scenarios and energy infrastructure plans. At CEA we are committed to empowering practitioners and researchers to plan future low-carbon cities.
