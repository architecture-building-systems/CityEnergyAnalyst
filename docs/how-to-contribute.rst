Contributing
============

This is a guide on how to expand CEA and become an official contributor!

The main steps you need to take are:

#. Create an User Story or a Bug in Github.
#. Create branch and learn how to use Github.
#. get acquainted with variable naming.
#. create your contribution.
#. test your creation.
#. Create a pull request on Github.
#. Claim your CEA T-shirt!

Step 1. Create a User Story or report a Bug
--------------------------------------------

If you decide to contribute to CEA is because you might have already an problem/feature in mind to solve/implement.

New features are called **User Stories**.

Problems are called **Bugs**

Check this guide for more details on how to create :doc:`how-to-create-user-stories`.

Check this guide for more details on :doc:`how-to-report-bugs`.


Step 2. Create a Github branch for your User story or Bug
----------------------------------------------------------

At CEA we create something called Branches for each User Story or Bug we would like to complete.

Check this guide for more details on how to do it: :doc:`how-to-use-github`.


Step 3. Get acquainted with variable names
------------------------------------------

If you have not done it yet, take some time to get acquainted with variable names in CEA. This would make easier for you to understand and develop consistent code.

Check this guide for more details: :doc:`how-to-name-variables`.


Step 4. Create your contribution
--------------------------------

Go ahead and start coding! For this make sure to use one of our template scripts and follow the documentation guide. This could help to maintain an homogenous structure, and help us to give you credits for your work.

Check this guide for more details: :doc:`how-to-add-a-new-script-to-the-cea`.

Check this guide for adding documentation :doc:`how-to-document-cea`.


Step 5. Test
------------

Now just test if your creation is not buggy.

Check this guide for more details on how to do it: :doc:`how-to-test-the-cea`.

And that is all! Many thanks for this!


Step 6. Create a Pull request
-----------------------------

Now it is time to ask other developer of CEA to review your code and put it inside the core of CEA. For this we will be creating a Pull Request in Github

Check this guide for more details on how to do it: :doc:`how-to-use-github`.



Step 7. Claim your CEA T-shirt!
-------------------------------

What happens after that? We will check the code, and if all is correct we will proceed to merge your User Story/ Github Branch into the CEA main core.

AND THAT IS ALL! if your work has been merged, give yourself an applause. You have just made part of the growing network of developers of CEA.

Your are entitled to claim a CEA T-shirt after this to cea@arch.ethz.ch
