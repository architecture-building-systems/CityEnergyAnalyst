Prerequisites:
to run the neural net you will need a minimum of 100 GB of hardisk available
for every 100 samples of a city with 230 buildings. (i.e. 1 GB/sample)

Install theano like this:
conda install numpy scipy mkl-service libpython m2w64-toolchain nose nose-parameterized sphinx pydot-ng

and make sure to include: conda install m2w64-toolchain

*The radiation file should be already generated.

To run, do:
1. check the nn_settings.py file
2. run the scalar_sampler.py
3. run scaler_fit.py

4. Now there are two posibilities for starting the training:
    4.1. the first is to generate x number of samples (100 in this example)
    and then train the network (these samples will be constant in all epochs):
        - run nn_pretrainer_pipeline.py
    4.2. the second is to randomly generate a smaller number of samples (max 10)
    and train the NN (these 10 samples will be updated in each epoch):
        - run nn_random_pipeline.py

5. Now there are two possibilities for continuing the training from step 4:
    5.1. continue training similar to that of 4.1.:
        - run nn_pretrainer_continue.py
    5.2. continue training similar to that of 4.2.:
        - run nn_trainer_continue.py

6. Evaluate the network (test the perforamnce based on a random sample)
    6.1. you can evaluate based on a random sample:
        - run nn_trainer_evaluate.py
    6.2 you can estimate the outputs based on the current inputs of CEA:
        - run nn-trainer_estimate.py
