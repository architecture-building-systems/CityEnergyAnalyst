Get Started with CEA
====================

This guide should get you started with the City Energy Analyst (CEA) |version|.

The City Energy Analyst (CEA) is an urban building simulation platform and one of the first open-source initiatives of
computation tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient cities. The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning
and energy systems engineering in an integrated simulation platform. This allows to study the effects, trade-offs and synergies
of urban design options and energy infrastructure plans.

For more information visit our presentation explaining `what is CEA and what can you do with it. <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZDiMlifMhCt3e3JcIX3JdVfG8PeHl1-Shs4DVWC3U8A/edit#slide=id.gc6f73a04f_0_0>`__.

Download a test case study
--------------------------

Just go to this `link <https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/CityEnergyAnalyst/tree/master/cea/examples>`__.and unzip the case study where necessary.

You can also use the command ``cea extract-reference-case --destination C:\Your\Favorite\Folder``. After completion,
that folder will contain a subfolder ``cea-reference-case`` which contains the ``baseline`` scenario of the test case
study.
