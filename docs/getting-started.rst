Get Started with CEA
====================

This guide should get you started with the City Energy Analyst (CEA) |version|.

The City Energy Analyst (CEA) is an urban building simulation platform and one of the first open-source initiatives of
computation tools for the design of low-carbon and highly efficient cities. The CEA combines knowledge of urban planning
and energy systems engineering in an integrated simulation platform. This allows to study the effects, trade-offs and synergies
of urban design options and energy infrastructure plans.
