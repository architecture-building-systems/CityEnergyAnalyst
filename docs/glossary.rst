Glossary
========
This glossary contains all the written input and output variables used by CEA. These variables are stored in
databases, themed by the type of information they contain. There are two main types of databases in CEA:
input and output. This glossary is organised through the cea's inputlocator method, which is used to retrieve
the information within each file.
