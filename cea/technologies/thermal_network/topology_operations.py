"""
Network topology operations for thermal network flow direction initialization.

This module contains functions for performing topological analysis and initialization
of flow directions in thermal networks using graph algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS).

These are NOT physics-based calculations, but rather fast heuristic approaches
to provide reasonable initial guesses for flow directions based on network topology.

    Initialize flow directions using Breadth-First Search (BFS) from plant nodes.
    
    BFS (Breadth-First Search) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the network
    topology level by level, starting from plant nodes and working outward. This provides
    a reasonable initial guess for flow directions based on network topology.
    
    NOTE: This is NOT a physics-based flow calculation. It's a purely topological approach
    that assumes flow goes from plants outward through the network to consumers. The actual
    flow directions and magnitudes will be calculated later using proper hydraulic equations.
    
    This replaces the problematic infinite loop with a fast O(N+E) deterministic approach.
